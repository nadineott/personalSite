  My name is Nadine and I'm a Software Engineer living in San Francisco. When I'm not wrangling an Angular app into submission and discovering what weird tricks CSS can pull on me next, I enjoy running, fawning over dogs on the sidewalk, and making what I call "apocalypse cake" (cake that requires no perishable ingredients, so when the zombie apogalypse comes we can still eat cake. You're welcome.)
