  My name is Nadine and I'm a Software Engineer living in San Francisco. When I'm not wrangling an Angular app into submission and discovering what weird tricks CSS can pull on me next, I enjoy running, fawning over dogs on the sidewalk, and making what I call "apocalypse cake" (cake that requires no perishable ingredients, so when the zombie apocalypse comes we can still eat cake. You're welcome.)

      Stress: Fear of Failure
      </div>
      <div class = "blogText">
        When I was in high school I had a dance coach who was, in my teenage eyes, the epitome of success and composure. It's been about 10 years since then and my opinion hasn't much changed. She was inspiring and fantastic for countless reasons, one of my favorites being the way she calmed me down one day after a particularly rough test. She told me that stress is just the fear of failure. I was afraid that I would get a bad grade on the test, and then in the class, and then not get into a good college and so on and so forth. In a nutshell- I was terrified of failure, and I was letting that fear get the best of me. I took a few deep breaths, let her remind me that one test wouldn't define my future, and walked with her to the dance studio.
        <br><br>
        She was right, of course. That one test didn't define my future. I went on to do just fine in high school and college. Even now when I find myself stressed out to the max, I take a few deep breaths and try to examine the larger picture of what I'm afriad of, usually failure to be good at my job, failure to make the right choices, or failure to live up to my own expectations. By zeroing in on exactly what fear is driving my stress I am generally able to calm myself down and figure out an action plan to eliminate the fear, and thus the stress. After all, any fear can be tackled, even the fear of failure.

        Nadine Ott: Job Hunter
      </div>
      <div class = "blogText">
        I feel like an absolute traitor. I've been dreading this time for so long, have had countless pep talks about how it won't be "that bad" and have pretty much come to terms with the fact that it will most likely be a horrible time that I'll endure before I start my next adventure. The truth is I'm about 3 hours into day 1 and I'm loving it! I've spent the morning sipping coffee, working through some tricky algorithm problems, researching companies that I find particularly compelling, and getting excited about all the fantastic places that are hiring.
        <br><br>
        Am I doing it wrong? Should I be tearing my hair out by the roots and screaming at my computer? Is this just the first step in the job hunt process, will my floor be covered in hair and tears in another 6 hours? Maybe, but there's also a chance that I've built this up so much in my mind that the actual process isn't horrible. Fingers crossed for the latter.

        In defense of CSS (a mini post)
      </div>
      <div class = "blogText">
        CSS is fairly universally hated and I don't feel that this is justified. CSS is one of the only things in code that you can entirely fake your way through. As coders, a classification of people who pride themselves on finding the most direct path to a solution, shouldn't this be the best news ever? Shouldn't we be pumped about something that has such a large impact on how people percieve our sites yet we constructed almost entirely by Googling "CSS how to..."? Yes, we should be pumped about it. I rest my case.

        Why Software Engineering (a mini post)
      </div>
      <div class = "blogText">
        Because magic. Allow me to explain. One of the first software engineers I met who made me say "yup, I've made the right choice" described it like this: think of Harry Potter, he does something with a special tool (wand) and says some magic words and has some special power and bam he can make something happen way on the other side of the room/castle/world. What other industry can we, muggles, do anything even close to that? Software engineering. With my magic tool (computer, lame I know but stay with me) and a few magic words (code, again I know lame but we're almost there) I can broadcast a message that someone can instantly see on the other side of the world, or set up an app where someone who I've never met can donate money to a third person who is desprately in need. If that's not magic, I don't know what is.

        How It Started
      </div>
      <div class = "blogText">
        Not long ago I found myself talking to my superior at work regarding a problem that, given an engineering fix, would have saved me about 30 minutes per day. Let me be clear- this was 30 minutes of entirely pointless transferring data from point A to point B. I was on a team of ten people, and assuming we all got hit with this issue equally, that would be about 5 hours per day, 25 hours per week, 100 hours per month. 100 hours a month to be used for far better puroses after this engineering fix, which apparently was a "week long fix"  on the part of an engineer. I'll equate that to 50 hours of work.
        <br><br>
        Bear with me here while I do some simple math. My team spent 100 hours per month doing this. It would have taken an engineer 50 hours to eliminate this process for my team completely. How great is that? Two weeks after implementing this fix the company would have broken even on employee time used vs. employee time gained. What I didn't understand was that my math was wrong. An hour of my time was not worth an hour of an engineer's time. Not even close.
        <br><br>
        When I proposed we move forward at full speed with the fix, I was told that it was not worth it. Mind. Blown. 100 hours of my teams time per month on an ongoing basis is not worth 50 hours of an engineer's time.
        <br><br>
        Have you ever been picked last for kickball? Or dumped out of nowhere by someone who you thought was pretty swell? It felt kind of like that. I wanted to jump up and down and scream "I'm a worthwhile person! I work my butt off and I'm pretty smart to boot! Why is my time worth nothing compared to that person's time?" Instead, I went with the smile, nod, and the ever fitting "Thanks for taking the time to look into it."
        <br><br>
        I thought about figuring out a way to bring this issue to my superiors in a new light, add more value to the proposition, you know the drill. But this hadn't been the first time I had been stonewalled with the company favorite "engineering effort" trump card. I had a feeling it wouldn't be the last. That night when I got home I Googled "learn to code."
        <br><br>
        And that's how it started.
